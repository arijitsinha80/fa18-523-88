The ActiveMQ project was created in 2004 by LogicBlaze. In 2007 
the ActiveMQ code was donated to the Apache Software Foundation 
with the original developers committed to developing and expanding
the codebase.

Apache ActiveMQ is a powerful open source messaging and Integration
Patterns server [@www-activeMQ]. It is a message oriented
middleware (MOM) for the Apache Software Foundation that provides high
availability, reliability, performance, scalability and security for
enterprise messaging [@ActiveMQ-book]. The goal of ActiveMQ is to
provide standard-based, message-oriented application integration
across as many languages and platforms as possible. ActiveMQ
implements the JMS spec and offers dozens of additional features and
value on top of this specifications. ActiveMQ is used in many
scenarios such as heterogeneous application integration, as a
replacement for RPC and to loosen the coupling between applications.



**Some of the features present in Apache ActiveMQ [@www-activeMQ]:**
 - Supports cross language clients and protocols(Java,C,C++,Ruby, Perl,Python PHP)
 - Supports JMS1.1 and J2EE1.4
 - REST API provides a technology agnostic API 
 - Designed for clustering, client-server and peer based communnication
